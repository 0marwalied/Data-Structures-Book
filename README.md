# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures Book â€“ C++ Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of data structures based on the book  
**"Data Structures Using C and C++" by Tannenbaum, Langsam, and Augenstein**.  
Each file provides clean, well-structured code to support learning, revision, and quick reference.
