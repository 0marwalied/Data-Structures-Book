# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures Book â€“ C++ Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of data structures based on the book  
**"Data Structures Using C and C++" by Tannenbaum, Langsam, and Augenstein**.  
Each file provides clean, well-structured code to support learning, revision, and quick reference.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- [`Intro/`](https://github.com/omar-walied/Data-Structures-Book/tree/main/Intro) â€“ Foundational concepts and rational number examples  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ [Floating Point Notation Problem.md](https://github.com/omar-walied/Data-Structures-Book/blob/main/Intro/Floating%20Point%20Notation%20Problem.md):  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explains floating-point representation issues and common pitfalls in C++.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ [rationalClass.cpp](https://github.com/omar-walied/Data-Structures-Book/blob/main/Intro/rationalClass.cpp):  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implements rational numbers using a C++ class, demonstrating operator overloading and inheritance.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ [rationalStruct.cpp](https://github.com/omar-walied/Data-Structures-Book/blob/main/Intro/rationalStruct.cpp):  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows rational numbers with a C++ struct, focusing on simplicity and core operator overloading.
